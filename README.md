# Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program


---
## Project Details
In this project you will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric.

---
## What Needs to Be Done
These files have been edited to complete the project
- `FusionEKF.cpp`: initialize the Kalman filter
    - initialize variables and matrices (x, F, H_laser, H_jacobian, P, etc.)
    - initialize the Kalman filter position vector with the first sensor measurements
    - modify the F and Q matrices prior to the prediction step based on the elapsed time between measurements
    - call the update step for either the lidar or radar sensor measurement. Because the update step for lidar and radar are slightly different, there are different functions for updating lidar and radar
- `kalman_filter.cpp`: implement predict and update equations
    - Update the state transition matrix F according to the new elapsed time. Time is measured in seconds
    - Update the process noise covariance matrix
    - Use the sensor type to perform the update step
    - Update the state and covariance matrices
- `Tools.cpp`: calculate RMS error and the Jacobian matrix
    - Calculate the RMSE
    - Calculate a Jacobian

### Summary
1. In `tools.cpp`, fill in the functions that calculate root mean squared error (RMSE) and the Jacobian matrix.
1. Fill in the code in `FusionEKF.cpp`. You'll need to initialize the Kalman Filter, prepare the Q and F matrices for the prediction step, and call the radar and lidar update functions.
1. In `kalman_filter.cpp`, fill out the `Predict()`, `Update()`, and `UpdateEKF()` functions.

## Simulation details
This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

Image legend:
- `Red circles`: lidar measurements are
- `Blue circles`: radar measurements with an arrow pointing in the direction of the observed angle
- `Green triangles`: estimation markers from running the Kalman Filter

The video below shows what the simulator looks like when a c++ script is using its Kalman filter to track the object. The simulator provides the script the measured data (either lidar or radar), and the script feeds back the measured estimation marker, and RMSE values from its Kalman filter.

## Installation and Setup
This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see the uWebSocketIO Starter Guide page in the classroom within the EKF Project lesson for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF

Tips for setting up your environment can be found in the classroom lesson for this project.

Note that the programs that need to be written to accomplish the project are src/FusionEKF.cpp, src/FusionEKF.h, kalman_filter.cpp, kalman_filter.h, tools.cpp, and tools.h

The program main.cpp has already been filled out, but feel free to modify it.

Here is the main protocol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.


**INPUT**: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


**OUTPUT**: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x

["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y

["rmse_x"]

["rmse_y"]

["rmse_vx"]

["rmse_vy"]

## Other Important Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF `

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

---
## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

---
## Generating Additional Data

`This is optional!`

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.

---
## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2 (three-term version) or Term 1 (two-term version)
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see the Project Resources page in the classroom
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Results
Target RMSE
px, py, vx, and vy RMSE should be less than or equal to the values `[.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52]`.

Achieved RMSE: `[0.10, 0.09, 0.48, 0.46]`.
